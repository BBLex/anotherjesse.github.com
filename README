Layout based on https://github.com/mislav/mislav.github.com

Idea:

  Notes in simplenoteapp.com (created via notational velocity) will be uploaded 
  to github as jekyll pages (using nvALT, you get a good markdown editor)

  Running a rake command will generate the latest version of all the notes
  and an index.  Only notes that start with "www" will be shared.
